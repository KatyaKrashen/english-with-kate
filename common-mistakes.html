        <h2>1. "I have 25 years old" vs. "I am 25 years old"</h2>
        <p>In English, we use "am" when talking about age, not "have." So, the correct sentence is "I am 25 years old."</p>

        <h2>2. "She can sings well" vs. "She can sing well"</h2>
        <p>After "can," we use the base form of the verb, so the correct sentence is "She can sing well."</p>

        <h2>3. "I like to go shopping" vs. "I like going shopping"</h2>
        <p>In English, both are correct, but "I like going shopping" is more commonly used when talking about hobbies or activities.</p>
